Currently working in Technical Support for intergrated power control and digital switching.    
Just learning and trying things out.  I am mostly focused on Python, Java / Kotlin, C (for embedded), Linux and Powershell Scripting.
I enjoy working with CANbus protocols (J1939, NMEA 2000, and MasterBUS)
Any Systems or Engineers out there?  I am interested in hardware and software engineering to solve modern problems.
Cloud Computing is another interest of mine.  Studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner at the moment.
I am humble, enjoy learning and love working with tech.
Any feedback is appreciated.
