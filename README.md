Currently working in Technical Support for intergrated power control and digital switching.  I LOVE WORKING WITH TECH!!  I have a website up, yes it's bootstrap. 
Just trying to learn.  I am mostly focused on Python, Java / Kotlin, C (for embedded), Linux and Powershell Scripting.
Any feedback is appreciated, I am humble and enjoy learning.
Any Embedded Systems Engineers out there?  I am interested in hardware and software engineering to solve modern problems.
Cloud Computing seems to also be a logical path, studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner at the moment...
