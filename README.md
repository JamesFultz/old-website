I am currently trying to make the move from field technician to programmer.  This is my current website, yes it's bootstrap. 
Any feedback is appreciated, I am humble and enjoy learning!
Any PLC or SCADA programmers out there?  I am interested in embedded software, but really software development is something I really enjoy.
