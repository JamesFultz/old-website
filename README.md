Currently working in Technical Support for intergrated power control and digital switching.  I LOVE WORKING WITH TECH!!  This is my current website, yes it's bootstrap. 
Any feedback is appreciated, I am humble and enjoy learning
Any Embedded Systems Engineers out there?  I am interested in hardware and software engineering to solve modern problems.
